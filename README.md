## üöÄ Project Setup

You can generate the solution from either:

- The GitHub repository URL
- A local clone of `project.cookiecutter`

Example:
```bash
cookiecutter gh:your-org/project.cookiecutter
# or
cookiecutter path/to/local/project.cookiecutter
```

---

## üß∞ Project Modes

During setup, you'll choose between two project modes:

- **Aspire** 
- **Docker**

## üõ†Ô∏è GitHub Setup

This project relies on two reusable workflows stored in the [`shared-workflows`](https://github.com/your-org/shared-workflows) repository:

- `validate_template_inputs.yml`
- `template_update.yml`

To ensure they function correctly, configure your GitHub project settings as follows:

### 1. Enable Reusable Workflows

Navigate to: **Settings** > **Actions** > **General**

- Under **Actions permissions**, select:
  > ‚úÖ **Allow all actions and reusable workflows**

- Under **Workflow permissions**, select:
  > ‚úÖ **Read repository contents and packages**

### 2. Define Required Repository Variable

Navigate to: **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** > **Variables** tab

- Add a variable named: `TemplateUpdateBranch`
- Set its value to the name of the branch you want updated by the template (e.g., `main`, `template`, etc.)

### 3. Scheduled Template Updates

By default, the workflow is scheduled to run every **Monday at 7:00 AM (UTC)**.  
It will:

- Look for the `TemplateUpdateBranch` repository variable.
- Fail if the variable is missing.
- Create a pull request if there are any changes detected in the upstream template.

### 4. Manual Update

You can also trigger the update manually via the **Actions** tab.  
When run manually, the workflow will prompt you to specify which branch should be updated.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** If your repo is public and  hasn‚Äôt had any commits/issues/discussions in the past 60 days, GitHub silently disables scheduled workflows. 
> 
> For additional information on the scheduled action [see documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)
>

## üìÑ Additional Info

Each mode (`Aspire`, `Docker`) includes a dedicated `README.md` within its generated folder for environment-specific setup and configuration instructions.
