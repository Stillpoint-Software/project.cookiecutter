## Project Setup

To setup your project, you can run the cookiecutter command setup in two ways.  The first, you can point to the **project.cookiecutter** GitHub Uri. Or, you can clone the `project.cookiecutter` Project and run the command from your machine.

Here is an example:
``cookiecutter {uri/path to project.cookiecutter} ``

*NOTE: You can't change the defaults if using the GitHub setup.*

## Default settings
If you cloned the repository, you can customize some of the default settings by editing the **.cookiecutterrc** file.

``cookiecutter {path to project.cookiecutter}   --overwrite-if-exists  --config-file={ path to the .cookiecutterrc file }``
